# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Project 16 — a risk-parity + volatility-targeting portfolio engine over four ETF sleeves
(SPY / TLT / DBC / TIP), backtested 2006→present through the GFC, COVID and the 2022 rate shock.
The deliverable is not just the engine: the analytical payload is **why risk parity failed in 2022**
when the stock/bond correlation flipped positive. Results that make the strategy look bad are
stated plainly, not hidden.

`PLAN.md` holds the design rationale and the pinned math. `TASKS.md` holds the numbered build
order — every step names one owner, one branch, and a "done when". Read the relevant step before
starting work; the step text is the spec.

## Setup and commands

System Python has no numpy on this machine — always work inside a venv.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
.venv/bin/python tests/test_contract.py      # Phase 0 gate: contract + metrics port + fixtures
.venv/bin/python tests/fixtures.py           # print a synthetic BacktestResult summary
.venv/bin/python run_backtest.py             # full run -> reports/   (exists from step 30)
```

Tests are **standalone scripts with no framework** — no pytest, no test runner. Each file defines
`test_*()` functions plus a `check(label, condition)` helper, and a `__main__` block calls them in
order and prints `N checks passed`. Run a single test file by running that file; run a single test
by calling its function in the `__main__` block. New test files must match this shape, including
the `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` preamble that makes `from src import ...` work when run from the
repo root.

PLAN.md and TASKS.md quote PowerShell paths (`.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe`) because Person A is on
Windows. On this machine use `.venv/bin/python`.

## Architecture

One module per pipeline stage under `src/`, wired end to end by `run_backtest.py`:

```
config.py → data.py → covariance.py → riskparity.py → overlay.py → backtest.py → BacktestResult
                                                                                       ↓
                                                          metrics.py / benchmarks.py / stress.py / viz.py
```

`src/__init__.py` carries the authoritative stage list. Modules past `backtest.py` in that list do
not exist yet — see TASKS.md for which step creates each.

### The contract is the load-bearing design decision

`src/types.py` defines `BacktestResult` (frozen dataclass: `weights`, `risk_contributions`,
`leverage`, `returns`, `meta`). It exists so two people on separate machines can build the engine
and the analysis layer *at the same time*: Person B builds charts, benchmarks and stress tests
against `tests/fixtures.make_fake_result()` long before a real engine runs, and Phase 5 swaps the
fixture for the real thing without touching anything downstream.

Consequences that constrain how you work:

- **Never modify `src/types.py` on a feature branch.** Changing the contract means announcing it
  first, then one PR that changes the contract and every call site together.
- **Every function that builds a `BacktestResult` calls `.validate()` before returning it.**
  `validate()` raises `ContractViolation` and is deliberately loud — a silently malformed result is
  the one failure mode that lets the two halves diverge unnoticed.
- Anything a run wants to surface but no chart depends on goes in `meta` (`strategy` is required).
- `weights` and `risk_contributions` are kept side by side rather than derived on demand, because
  their divergence *is* the project's thesis.

### Look-ahead is the invariant everything else rests on

At rebalance date `t`, only data timestamped `<= t` may be used — covariance, trailing vol estimate
and risk-free rate alike. `data.asof_slice()` is the single chokepoint for this; route new
estimators through it rather than re-deriving the guard at each call site.
`tests/test_lookahead.py` (step 28) exists to attack that one function.

### Conventions inherited from `abhyudayb-1/sp500-factor-backtester`

That repo is the house style and several files here are deliberate ports — **do not rewrite them**:

- `src/cache.py` is verbatim. Atomic `.tmp`-then-`replace` writes; CSV/JSON so the cache stays
  human-inspectable. `read_frame`/`write_frame` for date-indexed frames, `read_table`/`write_table`
  for tidy panels with a RangeIndex.
- `src/metrics.py` is ported with exactly one change: `periods_per_year` is a required argument,
  not a module constant, because this project accrues **daily** (252) while the original was
  monthly (12). Two subtleties in it look like noise and are not — `_ZERO_VARIANCE_EPS` (a bare
  `sd == 0` guard lets a Sharpe of ~1e16 through) and the drawdown peak floored at 1.0 (without it
  a window starting at a market peak reports 0% drawdown). Tests assert both.
- `src/viz.py` (step 26) reuses `_style_axes` / `_new_figure` / `_title` / `_save` and the palette.

### config.py is shared and append-only

Every magic number lives in `src/config.py`, never inline at a call site. It is the only file both
people write, so: add constants at the bottom of the relevant block, never reorder or reformat what
is there, and name the block you touched in the PR body.

Notable policy encoded there: `DATA_START_DATE = 2006-02-03` (DBC's inception — the brief asked for
2005 and the data cannot deliver it; state this rather than back-filling a proxy), `TARGET_VOL`,
`LEVERAGE_CAP = (0.5, 3.0)`, the three `CRISIS_WINDOWS`, and the EWMA halflives (vol halflife is
shorter than covariance halflife on purpose — the overlay should react faster than the weights).

### Data policy

Keyless sources only, so anyone can clone and run: yfinance for prices, the FRED CSV endpoint
(`fredgraph.csv?id=DTB3`) for the risk-free rate. No API keys anywhere in this project.

- Prices are pulled `auto_adjust=True` — the close series is **total return**. Not cosmetic: TLT and
  TIP pay most of their return as coupons, and a price-only series would badly understate the sleeve
  risk parity leans on hardest.
- `data.py` raises `DataUnavailableError` rather than degrading. A silently dropped sleeve produces
  a plausible equity curve and an entirely wrong conclusion.
- Leverage is **financed, not free**: `r_p = L_t·(r_assets − r_f) + r_f`. Omitting the financing leg
  is the most common way this strategy gets oversold.

## Working style for this repo

- Failures are surfaced, never swallowed. Solver non-convergence and covariance condition numbers
  go into `meta` and the run summary; bad data raises.
- Comments here explain *why* a subtle choice is correct (the ones that would otherwise get
  "simplified" away). Match that density — this is a capstone that gets read and defended, not
  just run.
- Ownership split: Person A (`abhyudayb-1`) owns the engine modules, Person B (`shivakasula`, this
  machine) owns metrics/benchmarks/stress/viz/tests/CLI/README. Only touch the files listed for the
  step you are on. Branches are `feat/a<NN>-slug` / `feat/b<NN>-slug`, one step per branch, merged
  before the next starts.
